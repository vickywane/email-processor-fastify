"At this point in my career   I have been involved in hiring decisions for hundreds of developers. This began in my previous roles as a software engineer at Microsoft and Facebook. At Educative I have helped grow an entire company from the ground up. Being a tech leader can be a handful. Time is limited. Speaking for myself   I only have 30 seconds to scan a resume and decide whether we should screen them. And right now   the market is more saturated with candidates than ever. The layoffs that have unfortunately continued into this year have unfortunately left thousands of developers without jobs — and many are highly qualified.  So what keywords do I look for when I m reviewing several applications? And if you make it to the tech screening or interview   what skills do I focus on?"
