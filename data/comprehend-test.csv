"what is a copper calorimeter? \n what are stemcells\nwho was shakespear\nwho was akasha\nwho was harry houdini\nwhat are dinosaurs \n A copper calorimeter is a small solid block of pure copper in a vacuum that has thermocouple wires attached to it to measure the rise in temperature of the block with exposure of the block to controlled amounts of energy from a heat source. Thermal loss must be minimized&#44; readings must be immediate&#44; calibrations must be highly accurate&#44; temperature variations within the block must be eliminated (hence the need for a small block)."

For instance&#44; I am involved in a number of business (as an IBO) and I have a separate bank account for income and expenses for them (ie: one bank account&#44; several streams of income and expenses&#44; but the IRS would like to see personal monies and business monies separated.

"what is the difference between socket 754 and socket 939 motheboards? \n its the amount if pins on the processor&#44; thus a 754 wont fit into a 939 or visa versa.\n754 was the first mainstream amd64 socket. the max cpu that will be made for it is the 3700amd64. it is going to now be the budget line so it wont be developed a whole lot further as for as mainboard features. it does not feature dual channel memory.\nskt939 is the current enduser socket. processor speeds are going beyond dual core 4800+ processors so there is a definate upgrade path. it can handle dual channel memory. the motheboards have features like the nf4 chipset including SLI&#44; pci-express&#44; better sata options&#44; and more. since better chips/chipsets are being manufactured on 939 it is also perferred for overclockers and \nThe major difference between S754 and S939 is that S939 processors have a 128-bit memory controller and the S754 has a 64-bit memory controller. In other words&#44; dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it&#44; from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI&#44; PCI-E&#44; etc)&#44; those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards&#44; simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money."

"Who started Catholicism? \n The developement of the Catholic Church makes for interesting historical reading.  Various doctrines to which it holds can be pinpointed to certain dates and people.  For example&#44; the concept of sprinkling instead of immersing for baptism goes to the late 3rd century.  A man named Novatian was on what he thought was his deathbed&#44; and wanted to be baptized&#44; so they sprinkled him. This is the first record of sprinkling in history.  When he recovered&#44; he wanted to be made a bishop.  The entire church was outraged&#44; because they all asserted that he wasn't baptized correctly.  So he was immersed&#44; and became a bishop.  \n\nAnother interesting sidebar in the developement of Catholic doctrine was the Quartodeciman controversy&#44; in the middle of the second century.  Because of the Bar Kochba revolt in Palestine&#44; the Roman government forbade all Jews from being anywhere near Jerusalem.  The Sanhedrin was no longer able to produce its religious calendar.  Not only did this impact the Jews&#44; but it impacted Christianity as well&#44; because up to that point the Christians depended upon the Jewish calendar to determine when to observe Passover&#44; to honor the death&#44; burial&#44; and resurrection of Messiah.  So the bishop of Rome (I believe it was Anastasius at the time&#44; I could be wrong&#44; and I am too lazy to look it up)&#44; decided that because Messiah was raised on the first day of the week&#44; the Passover would be observed on a Sunday every year.  This eventually developed into Easter.  Anyhow&#44; Polycarp&#44; bishop of Smyrna&#44; and the eastern churches initially rejected this move.  Polycarp&#44; who was taught by the Apostle John&#44; said that John told him that Passover must be observed on 14 Nissan every year&#44; regardless of upon what day of the week it fell.  Polycarp did not deny that Christ arose on a Sunday&#44; and Anastasius did not deny that Christ was crucified on Passover&#44; the controversy was about when the Lord's Supper should be observed.\n\nThe development of the doctrine that infants are born sinful can be traced back to Augustine&#44; bishop of Hippo&#44; in the mid 4th century.\n\nThe introduction of musical instruments can be dated in the 600's A.D.\n\nThe developement of the current ecclesiastical arrangement of the Catholic Church is quite fascinating.  Initially&#44; each congregation was autonomous&#44; and governed by a board of men known simply as presbyters (elders).  This office was also known as the episcopoi (overseers/bishops)&#44; or poimoine (pastors).  This office was quite distinct from that of the evangelists (preachers) and deacons (ministers/servants).  Anyhow&#44; Ignatius&#44; the bishop of Antioch in the mid to late second century&#44; was the first to suggest that only one of the men be called the episcopos&#44; and the rest called presbyters.  Up to that point&#44; no one presbyter/episcopos had any more authority than any other.  The word episcopos&#44; eventually was shortened to piscops&#44; then to bischop&#44; to our current form of bishop.  The term presbyters was eventually shortened to prester&#44; then prest&#44; and in its current form of priest.  What started to happen was that if a city had several congregations&#44; the bishop of most affluentual of them began to gain authority over the others.  Soon&#44; all the smaller congregations dropped the bishops&#44; but retained their presbyters&#44; and acknowledged the authority of the bishop of the leading congregation in the town.  Soon&#44; there were five prominent congregations throughout Christendom: Jerusalem&#44; Antioch&#44; Constantinople&#44; Alexandria&#44; and Rome&#44; and each of these vied for the prominence&#44; but none was willing to give any foot to the other.  With the advent of the splitting of the Roman Empire into east and west&#44; the barbarian incursions&#44; and the advent of Islam&#44; only two congregations of these powerhouses remained to have any influence: Rome and Constantinople.  The story of their bickering back and forth with each other&#44; and how I believe in 1054&#44; thereabouts (can't remember the exact date)&#44; the Bishop of Rome and the"

Buddha had a disciple Amrapali who used to be a prostitute then became a nun when came in contact with Buddha. What is that accepted story about Magdalen?\n\nchristians adopted same type of managing style of church as buddhist Vihar. the idea of celibate priests&#44; nuns etc. earlier buddhist did not allowed females in monastries. Some early buddhist schollars  were against it others thought women should be allowed.Afterwards they were allowed to join as nuns but really not given important posts among high officials.\n\nBesides that Christians had already inherited stories from their native sourses. From Pagans to jew.\n\nthe idea of only true god and true belief has a Jewish source as far as i know.\n\nThe missioneries in India have regularly made up stories or changed them a bit or simply borrowed local tales. Im Baar geets Asam they replaced name of jesus with Rama and Krishna. In Nahaland they replaced Jesus with Local hero and called him a victor. Last year they made up stalls on Krishna Janmashtami(birth day) and depicted infact jesus in place of krishna.\n\n It is said that Lord Shiva drank all the poison Himself which came out of cosmic churn so that living world is saved.\n\nWhen they are borrowing this much today to get mixed up and using deceit to get converts how can be anyone sure that they did not do it from the start.\n\nI can perceive it from a limited knowledge. I am sure peole who have compared the other religious thoughts know it as a fact. they accept it openly or not. Accept the concept of Jesus for everybody what else is really original?"

You have to be able to decide who you want to be.  \n\nThe \"Good Guys\" are those that have your best interests at heart&#44; and prove it.  They are those that will help you when you need it&#44; and they are those that you look up to the most.\n\nThe \"Bad Guys\" are those that do the opposite.  They only want what is best for themselves&#44; and will do anything to achieve that goal.\n\nAs the other poster said&#44; we all have \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" inside of us.  It's up to us to figure out who we want to be.  We will never always be the \"good guy\"&#44; because there will always be something we want to badly.  We can only try to soften the blow.\n\nLiving in a world where you don't know anything&#44; however&#44; does NOTHING but leave you open as a target for the bad guys."
"Is he trying to get my attention? \n theirs this guy i like and im not sure if he likes me back. at this party he was acting so nice and he was flirting with me by blowing bubbles at me and throwing some bubble juice on me. this was for fun but he started it. then he would sit by me inside and start talking to me. now at school when we switch classes (hes not in my class) im guessing hes trying to get me to notice him because hell always try to make me laugh and hell be like doing crazy dances around me and doing funny things&#44; cause i do like a funny guy&#44; (the things he will do are cute) when we past. and today we had a nice conversation in the lunch line. what do you think. does he like me or what? \n Yep&#44; that sounds like flirting to me... usually when guys flirt with me&#44; they get goofy and try to make me laugh.

That would be the best gift.  Can you find anything out about him before seeing him?\n\nMy 8 year old is into baseball right now&#44; perhaps your new little brother is into something similiar.  Try to learn about him before seeing him.\n\nMost of all&#44; accept him as your little brother now.  It's not his fault your Dad did what he did.  It will be your choice however&#44; on whether you accept this boy into your life.  People come in and out of our lives for a reason."
"7 events with explanations about world war 2 plzz? \n any of the many are exceptiable. please help me! \n 1) Krystal Nacht- (the night of broken glass) It was a night at the begginning of the Nazi regime in which the SS vandalized business owned by Jews.\n2) D-Day- the landing of Allied troops at Normandy. This was the first entrance of US troops in the European theater.  It was met with heavy casualties on both sides.  \n3) Pearl Harbor- Japanese kamikaze (sp?) pilots bombed the US naval base in Hawaii in Dec. 1942 hurling the US into war with Japan.\n4) A-bomb- The US dropped the world's first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan&#44; ending the war in the Pacific. \n5) raising the flag at Iwo Jima- US Marines captured the Island of Iwo Jima in the South Pacific&#44; a vital control point in the theater. A national monument in DC depicts the picture taken for Time magazine showing the flag being raised. This was&#44; however&#44; the second flag to go up.\n\nThose are the only ones I can think of. Wikipedia will have info on each of those in more detail.  Try also V-Day and the signing of the Neuremburg Treaty as number 6 and 7."

"Why did United States allow Mexican immigrates come through the border two decades ago? \n It has gone too far with politics.  I beleive we should all have identification to be in this country.  People who do not have proper i.d. can get away with breaking the law&#44; like criminals&#44; robbers&#44; child ped.&#44; rape.  The law should stop them now&#44; its time.  what do you think? \n Twenty years ago was then&#44; this is now&#44; and the influx has increased to the point where it is now becoming a major issue.  It is estimated by 2010 some 14% of the US population will be Mexican&#44; and half of that illegal. An idea of the scope of the problem is that right now 25% of all automobile accidents in North Carolina are caused by illegal Mexican drivers.\n\nWe have ID now. This is not the issue.  We do not need one more form of ID which will be just as readily forged as Social Security cards. The problem is the willingness of government to tackle the issue. An example of disservice to America is that socialistic pig from Massachussetts&#44; Ted Kennedy&#44; who is an open supporter of illegal imigration and should be evicted from the Senate and jailed.\n\nThe borders need to be secured first to stop the Mexican invasion&#44; and then the issue of hiring illegals needs to be addressed.\n\nThe US is willing to send hundreds of thousands of troops to foreign lands to help the people there&#44; so what about sending 100&#44;000 troops to patrol our southern border?  That would put one solder every 31 feet.  Arm them heavily and that should put a stop to the swarming hoardes of criminal immigrants sneaking into this country."

"I just wonder why we allow the u.s. mint people to keep and then sell later like 40yrs or so them for big$$$$$ \n Since this is a 'money making' enterprise&#44; I don't have a problem with it.  I would be concerned if they were selling at a loss.  Coin collectors would have a gripe if they released old product below the market.  They did this 30 years ago with CC silver coins."
"wieght loss? \n well in the past 6 months or so ive gained 80 pounds and have been trying to loose it.  ive tried crash dieting a few times but have never had the will power to go threw with it. what i need is how to get the will power \n Crash dieting will make you fatter in the long run. This is because your body goes into starvation mode. The human body is designed to hang onto fat in case of famine. This is something that we have carried with us since before we were living in caves and evolved because food sources were less certain at that time. We live in a modern world now where there is plenty of food. But our evolution is still in the caves and our bodies do not recognise this (unfortunately). Hence the minute we cut calories drastically to try to lose weight quickly&#44; our bodies behave as though each meal will be our last. The end result is our metabolisms slow right down. That is why we often end up fatter after a period of crash dieting. \n\nWhat you need to do is try to shift your mindset and make a lifestyle change that you will stick to. This calls for a new way of looking at food and eating for the rest of your life. The problem with diets is most people see them as short term fixes. Once they have achieved what they want to achieve (i.e. weight loss)&#44; lots of people just go back to their former eating habits - then they are surprised that the weight comes back again - in spades!\n\nNutritionists everywhere agree that a healthy&#44; balanced diet is the key to good health. Focus your diet on variety - primarily brightly coloured vegetables and fruit (no more than 2 pieces of fruit a day - 3 in a pinch) with more focus on vegetables. Give up mayo and fatty dressings. Cut fat off meat - visible fat - and remove the skin from chicken. Cook with any method that does not involve adding fat. Do not eat anything in breadcrumbs or pastry. Reduce bread but if you can't&#44; eat wholegrain bread. Reduce fats generally. Minimise fast food. Drink water instead of fruit juices and diet soda (I posted something here about diet soda earlier - it is not our friend!). Cut out ALL processed foods - white anything&#44; sugar&#44; candy and cakes. Instead&#44; snack on nuts (or raw vegetables not dried fruit). \n\nMost of all&#44; accept that you did not get fat overnight and you will not get slim overnight either. Tell yourself that this is a long term solution and you are willing to do the whole haul for the sake of your health.\n\nIf you decide not to follow these principles and instead try to crash diet again&#44; chances are in 6 months - a year's time&#44; you will be looking back still fat (if not fatter) and asking the same question about weight loss."

"In DELPHI&#44; function IF...THEN...ELSE&#44; how can I separate in time different instructions? \n After \"then\" I have a serie of instructions including one that ends as follows:\ntimer.interval := 30000;\nSo I would like to ad more instructions to continue after the time is elapsed. \n You can add another IF...THEN...ELSE in the timer (double click the timer&#44; or you can say in event Timer.OnTimer).\nLet's said by default (interval is 1000)&#44; you have a set of instruction in Timer. And after the interval is changed to 3000&#44; you want the timer \"do\" something else.\nWell just do like this\nTimer.OnTimer\n  IF (Timer.Interval = 1000) THEN\n   {your instruction here}\n  ELSE IF (Timer.Interval = 3000) THEN\n   {your instruction here}\n  ELSE\n   {your instruction here};\nend;\nLike that. That way&#44; the timer will do something different each time you change the interval. You can add more (ELSE IF... THEN) if you want more instruction for different intervals."

I've tried with just the battery and with both the AC and battery. The computer is an IMB ThinkPad T22 and is running with Windows 2000 (I think) \n If you have another working computer&#44; you could take the hard drive out of that machine and put it in your other computer as a slave drive.  That way you can boot the working computer&#44; and the transplanted hard drive will show up as the E:/ drive (or other letter&#44; depending on what all is in your system) and you can copy all the files over.\n\nYou may need a special adapter to plug a notebook hard drive into a desktop computer&#44; but you should be able to pick one up at radio shack for pretty cheap."

"what are polymorphic calls? \n Polymorphism deals with abstract classes&#44; where a virtual method is defined&#44; but an implementation is not provided. It is up to the derived concrete class to provide the implemenation&#44; which could vary widely from derived class to derived class.\n\nA client program calls the virtual method&#44; but the functionality executed will vary depending upon the concrete class implementing the abstract interface being used.\n\nThe classic example is the abstract class Shape&#44; used in a graphical design program. Many real shapes are derived from it&#44; such as&#44; Circle&#44; Square&#44; Rectangle and Line. Shape defines the abstract draw() method&#44; but each derived class has to provide the implementation&#44; which will vary for each of the above.\n\nNow the set of Shapes in a picture can be drawn with a method that looks like of like the following...\n\nPicture::draw()\n{\nfor each shape in Shape...\nshape.draw()\n}\n\nIf Picture contains all circles&#44; then only Circle::draw() will be called. If it contains all squares&#44; then only Square::draw() will be called&#44; If the Picture contains a mixture of shapes&#44; then each unique draw() method will be called.\n\nIf  new shape is added&#44; Picture::draw() doesn't need to be changed."

"what foods should a man eat if he wishes to increase the amount of semen he produces? \n Generally – when you ejaculate&#44; you use a portion of the quantity of  available ejaculate that your body has produced up to that time.\n\nIf you want to ejaculate more on a regular basis&#44; then you need to ejaculate more often&#44; and your body will produce more ejaculate on a regular basis&#44; because your body produces what it needs; this is sort of like keeping a larger supply on hand to meet a larger demand.  Our bodies are wonderfully adaptive that way.  It is sort of like working out – the more you lift&#44; the more you are able to lift&#44; and  the same is true for your ejaculate – the more you ejaculate&#44; the more you will be able to.\n\nIf&#44; for some reason&#44; you just want to ejaculate a large quantity at one specific time&#44; or over a short duration&#44; then you can simply “save up” or not ejaculate for a period of days prior to the event where you wish to be able to provide a large quantity all at once.\n\nThis is why girls like myself&#44; who really enjoy semen&#44; and being coated&#44; will often ask guys to not ejaculate for the few days before they plan on seeing us – we want them to save up a lot of semen for us."
"gift for parents 25th anniversary??? \n My parents 25th wedding anniversary is comming up in about a week or so and I don't have a gift for them yet.

They have two kids&#44; my brother and I. They have pretty much anything and everything they need and rarely say they want anything. \n For my parents 25th we held a small barbeque for the family&#44; about 15 people were there(not counting the young kids) and the big surprise of the night was when the wedding party showed up&#44; they had not seen the maid of honour or the best man in years. It was great. \nAnything you do or get them will be treasured by them&#44; just make it personalized&#44; don't get them something they could easily pick up themselves."
"What is the role of religion in society? \n At what point in the development of societies did religion&#44; or at least some form of pre-religious organized belief structure&#44; come to exist?\n\nHow and why did religion form? Is it merely the result of the organization of beliefs&#44; or does religion fulfill a particular societal need? Put another way&#44; is religion the organization of a primarily personal phenomenon&#44; or is it more societal in nature? What is the relationship between the individual&#44; the religion and the society?\n\nIf religion fulfills certain societal or personal needs&#44; what are these needs&#44; and can they be fulfilled outside religion? How are they fulfilled today&#44; if they are? \n It is the moral fabric and value system that people need.  Faith gives life a purpose and meaning.  The church itself provides a supportive community for individuals in many phases of life.  The church can be a loving&#44; supportive&#44; but also disciplining part of the person's life.  The people of the faith community provide a lot of benevolent care to the needy of the community and do it out of their own time and pocketbook.    Faith in God continually points away from a self centered view of life to caring about others and giving to the needs of our immediate community."
